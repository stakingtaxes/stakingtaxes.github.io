# Liquid Staking

Popular choices: **[Lido Finance](https://lido.fi/)**, **[Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/)**, **[Coinbase cbETH](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth)**

Liquid staking is a popular option for those who want to stake ETH but do not have the technical expertise to stake themselves or do not have sufficient capital to do so (since the minimum required to run a validator is 32 ETH).

Liquid staking protocols like **[Lido Finance](https://lido.fi/)** and **[Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/)** allow users to deposit ETH and then get a token such as stETH or rETH which represents the usersâ€™ ownership of the underlying staked assets as well as any rewards earned. Liquid staking tokens are transferable and can be unwrapped to exchange for the underlying staked assets. Liquid staking protocols take a cut of the rewards earned as their fee.
