# Key Events in Ethereum Staking

There have been a few key events in Ethereum’s staking history that affect the calculation of taxes.

## 1. Ethereum Merge

Ethereum’s consensus mechanism used to be Proof-of-Work and miners instead of validators secured the network. When Ethereum was still using the Proof-of-Work system, the Consensus Layer was baked into the Execution Layer. The Beacon Chain was shipped on 1 December 2020 and co-existed while Ethereum was still using Proof-of-Work as a consensus mechanism.

The Ethereum Merge took place on 15 September 2022 and consensus moved from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. Post-merge, the Consensus Layer was moved to an external client.

## 2. Shapella Upgrade and withdrawals

The Shapella Upgrade took place on 12 Apr 2023

Before the Shapella Upgrade, validators who had been staking for >2 years since the Beacon Chain started could not withdraw their Consensus Layer rewards. Once withdrawals were enabled, this released >2 years of earnings to validators who started staking at Beacon Chain genesis on 1 December 2020.

Note: Execution Layer rewards are not affected since they have always been available for spending immediately.

## Other ways to get staking exposure

We’ve covered what staking taxes look like for solo stakers. The underlying principles of staking are unchanged. However, most investors are not running validators themselves - they are getting exposure to staking through services where others run validators.
