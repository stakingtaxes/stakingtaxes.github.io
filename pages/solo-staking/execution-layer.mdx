| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Priority Fees | Execution | Included in every Block Proposal containing transactions | Typically 0.01 to 0.1 ETH; very rarely 1+ ETH |
| MEV Rewards   | Execution | Also included in Block Proposals when using MEV-boost    | Typically 0.01 to 0.1 ETH; very rarely 1+ ETH |

## How rewards on the Execution Layer can be tracked

While Consensus Layer rewards were only withdrawable after the Shapella upgrade, Priority Fees and MEV Rewards are sent to an Execution Layer address and have been available for spending immediately.

Tracking MEV fees is tricky as a third party. In a MEV block, a block builder replaces the `fee_recipient` from the validator’s `suggested_fee_recipient` to the builder’s address. Then, in the last transaction of the block, the builder does a plain ETH transfer to the original `suggested_fee_recipient`. The original `suggested_fee_recipient` data is not on-chain.

As such, the only way to capture the track the accurate Execution Layer income number as a third party is if you know which exact address Execution Layer rewards are being sent to for that specific validator.
