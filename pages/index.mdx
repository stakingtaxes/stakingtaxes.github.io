## Understanding Staking Taxes

There are various ways to stake. We start off with the basic concepts on how validators stake ETH, the different types of rewards and then dive into the other ways which investors use to gain exposure to staking.

Staking taxes are an evolving area and most countries have not issued detailed guidance on how staking should be taxed.

## Understanding how a validator earns ETH

1. Validators that participate in securing the [Beacon Chain](https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/staking-glossary#beacon-chain) and execute duties get rewarded with new issuance of ETH. These activities happen at the **Consensus Layer**, i.e. “which block is next” and include the following: **attestations, block proposals, sync committees, slashing reports.**

2. In addition, validators also receive **priority fees** paid by users, and optionally **Maximal Extractable Value activities** [MEV](https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/staking-glossary#mev) from block proposals. Priority fees and MEV are paid from ETH that already exist. These activities happen at the **Execution Layer**, “the Ethereum Virtual Machine” where user transactions take place.
