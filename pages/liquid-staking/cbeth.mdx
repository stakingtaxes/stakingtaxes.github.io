# cbETH **[Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth)**

Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) is the liquid staking token offered by Coinbase

Note: Coinbase has different staking offerings. Investors can stake with Coinbase as a centralized exchange (in which case no cbETH is involved). Coinbase also has a liquid staking token cbETH that is an interesting hybrid. While it is offered by Coinbase, cbETH can be transferred into any wallet outside Coinbase and traded outside the exchange.

cbETH is a non-rebasing token similar to wstETH and rETH.

cbETH will have rights to underlying staked ETH and accrued rewards and penalties. Changes in these underlying amounts would have effects on the conversion rate between cbETH and ETH. One can unwrap cbETH at any time. Rewards are earned but not directly through Coinbase

## Taxes

Wrapping and unwrapping cbETH generally are not considered taxable events, and selling cbETH is taxed as capital gain or loss.

ETH staking rewards and cbETH earnings will be considered income as theyâ€™re paid out every 3-4 days.
