Germany has friendly crypto taxation rules. Staking rewards are taxed as income, however the staked coins themselves are not taxed if held for more than a year.

The BZSt says you'll pay Income Tax on staking rewards based on the fair market value of any coins in EUR on the day you received them.

An important thing to note regarding staking taxes that the BZSt has now clarified is the holding period for staked tokens. Originally, investors thought that they'd pay Income Tax on any profits from disposing of staked tokens held for less than 10 years. However, this has now changed to the standard one-year holding period after updated guidance in 2022.

This means you'll only pay Income Tax on profits when you dispose of staked tokens if you've held them for less than one year, otherwise, it's tax free. the initial 32 ETH would not apply since you held that initial investment for 2 years. Capital gains on the difference between the cost basis and sell price of earned ETH would only apply to ETH earned in the last 1 year.
