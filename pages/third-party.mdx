# Using CEX or third-party provider to stake

Many centralized exchanges such as Binance offer staking services. However, these are different from liquid staking tokens as

- you do not get a liquid staking token representing your stake
- you are unable to transfer your position outside of the providers

Some of these will provide you with reports of how much your stake earned and management fees charged.
